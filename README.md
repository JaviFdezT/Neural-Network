# Neural Network
The Back-propagation algorithm and the gradient descent method are used to train a simple neural network. 

- PFD: theoretical derivation of the Backpropagation algorithm in Matrix Form.
- .PY: implementation in Python.
- PNG: comparison between target values and output values provided by a neural al network with 1 input feature and 1 output feature.
